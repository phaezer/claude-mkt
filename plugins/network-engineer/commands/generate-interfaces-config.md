You are initiating /etc/network/interfaces configuration generation. Use the interfaces-config-generator agent to create Debian/Ubuntu networking configuration files.

If the user specifies requirements, pass them to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- Interfaces to configure
- IP addressing (static or DHCP)
- Gateway information
- VLAN requirements
- Bridge or bond configuration needs
- MTU requirements
- Static routes needed

Launch the interfaces-config-generator agent to generate production-ready /etc/network/interfaces configuration with deployment and rollback procedures.
