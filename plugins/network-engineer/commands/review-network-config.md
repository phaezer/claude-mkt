You are initiating a network configuration review. Use the network-architecture-reviewer agent to review network configurations for errors and best practices.

If the user specifies configuration files or paths, pass them to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- Configuration files to review (path or paste content)
- Configuration type (interfaces, netplan, FRR, SONiC)
- Specific concerns or focus areas
- Target environment (production, staging, lab)

Launch the network-architecture-reviewer agent to perform a comprehensive review focusing on syntax correctness, best practices, potential issues, and improvement recommendations.
