You are orchestrating a network design workflow. Use the network-orchestrator agent to design and plan network architecture based on the user's requirements.

If the user provides specific requirements, pass them to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- Network type (data center, campus, branch, etc.)
- Scale requirements (number of devices, users, throughput)
- Redundancy requirements
- Routing protocol preferences
- Security requirements
- Any specific constraints or requirements

Launch the network-orchestrator agent with a detailed design task that includes architecture planning, topology design, IP addressing scheme, and routing protocol selection.
