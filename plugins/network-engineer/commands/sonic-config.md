You are initiating SONiC NOS configuration. Use the sonic-engineer agent to work with SONiC Network Operating System.

If the user specifies requirements, pass them to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- SONiC version (community or enterprise)
- Configuration type (interfaces, VLANs, BGP, ACLs, QoS)
- Interface requirements
- Routing protocol needs
- Platform/hardware information
- Specific operational commands needed

Launch the sonic-engineer agent to generate SONiC config_db.json configuration files or provide operational commands for SONiC management.
