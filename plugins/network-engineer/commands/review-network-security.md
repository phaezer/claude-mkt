You are initiating a network security review based on NIST standards. Use the network-security-reviewer agent to perform a comprehensive security assessment.

If the user specifies what to review, pass it to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- Network architecture or configuration to review
- Configuration files or network diagrams
- Criticality level (production, internet-facing, internal)
- Specific NIST compliance requirements
- Any known security concerns

Launch the network-security-reviewer agent to perform a NIST-aligned security review covering access control, encryption, routing security, DoS protection, logging, and compliance.
