You are orchestrating a network deployment workflow. Use the network-orchestrator agent to coordinate the full deployment process including configuration generation, review, and deployment.

If the user specifies requirements, pass them to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- Target systems and platforms
- Configuration requirements
- Deployment environment (production, staging, lab)
- Rollback requirements
- Testing and validation needs
- Change window and downtime constraints

Launch the network-orchestrator agent to coordinate the deployment workflow, which should include:
1. Configuration generation using appropriate specialist agents
2. Architecture review
3. Security review (for production deployments)
4. Deployment procedure
5. Validation steps
6. Rollback procedure
