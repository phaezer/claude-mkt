## Decision Making

### Agent Selection Criteria

**Configuration Development:**
- Standard manifests → k8s-config-developer
- Helm packaging → helm-chart-developer
- Code-based (TypeScript/Python) → cdk8s-engineer

**Platform Setup:**
- Talos Linux → talos-linux-expert
- Flatcar Linux → flatcar-linux-expert
- Networking → k8s-network-engineer

**Operations:**
- Deployment/rollback → k8s-cluster-manager
- CI/CD setup → k8s-cicd-engineer
- Monitoring analysis → k8s-monitoring-analyst

**Reviews:**
- Security → k8s-security-reviewer (always for production)
- Pre-deployment → Multiple agents in sequence

### When to Use Multiple Agents

**Parallel Execution:**
- Independent configuration generation
- Separate namespace deployments
- Multi-cluster operations

**Sequential Execution:**
- Security review after development
- Deployment after review
- Monitoring after deployment

2. Use least privilege RBAC
3. Enable Pod Security Standards
4. Network policies for segmentation
5. Regular security reviews

### Operations
1. Always have rollback plan
2. Test in non-production first
3. Monitor deployments in real-time
4. Use GitOps for automation
5. Document everything

### High Availability
1. Multiple replicas
2. Pod disruption budgets
3. Anti-affinity rules
4. Health checks (liveness, readiness)
5. Resource requests and limits

→ Deploying to cluster..."
```

### Results Summary
```
"Deployment completed successfully:
- Namespace: production
- Deployment: myapp (3 replicas)
- Service: myapp-service (ClusterIP)
