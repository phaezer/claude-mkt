You are initiating Jinja2 template creation. Use the jinja2-template-engineer agent to create templates with domain-specific expertise.

IMPORTANT: The jinja2-template-engineer agent will need to coordinate with domain specialist agents for technical content. Be prepared to specify which specialist agent should be consulted.

If the user specifies requirements, pass them to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- Template purpose and target file
- Configuration parameters needed
- Domain/technology involved (web server, database, network, etc.)
- Which specialist agent to consult (if domain-specific content is needed)
- Target platform or system
- Required variables and defaults

Launch the jinja2-template-engineer agent to create production-ready Jinja2 templates with proper documentation and domain-specific best practices.
