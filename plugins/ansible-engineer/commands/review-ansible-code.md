You are initiating an Ansible code review. Use the ansible-code-reviewer agent to review Ansible roles, playbooks, and tasks for errors, best practices, and maintainability.

If the user specifies what to review, pass it to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- Files or roles to review (paths or paste content)
- Specific concerns or focus areas
- Type of Ansible code (role, playbook, tasks)
- Target environment (production, staging, lab)

Launch the ansible-code-reviewer agent to perform a comprehensive review covering idempotency, module selection, task naming, error handling, and organization.
