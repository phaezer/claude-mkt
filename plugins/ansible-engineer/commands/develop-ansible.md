You are initiating Ansible development. Use the ansible-developer agent to create Ansible roles, playbooks, tasks, and handlers.

If the user specifies requirements, pass them to the agent. Otherwise, ask the user for:
- What to develop (role, playbook, or specific tasks)
- Purpose and functionality
- Target systems/platforms
- Required packages or dependencies
- Variables and defaults needed
- Any specific requirements or constraints

Launch the ansible-developer agent to create production-ready Ansible automation following best practices for idempotency, organization, and maintainability.
