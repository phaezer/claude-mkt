You are initiating Kubernetes rollback. Use the k8s-cluster-manager agent to rollback a deployment.

If the user specifies details, pass to the agent. Otherwise, ask for:
- Deployment/StatefulSet name
- Namespace
- Target revision (or previous)
- Reason for rollback

Launch the k8s-cluster-manager agent to execute the rollback.
