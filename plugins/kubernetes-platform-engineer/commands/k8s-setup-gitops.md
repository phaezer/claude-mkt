You are initiating GitOps CI/CD setup. Use the cicd-engineer agent.

If the user specifies requirements, pass to the agent. Otherwise, ask for:
- GitOps tool preference (ArgoCD or Flux)
- Git repository details
- Applications to manage
- Environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Progressive delivery needs

Launch the cicd-engineer agent to setup GitOps automation.
