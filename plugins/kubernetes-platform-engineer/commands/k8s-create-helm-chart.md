You are initiating Helm chart development. Use the helm-chart-developer agent to create a Helm chart.

If the user specifies requirements, pass them to the agent. Otherwise, ask for:
- Application name and description
- Default values needed
- Dependencies
- Chart version
- Target Kubernetes version

Launch the helm-chart-developer agent to create a complete Helm chart with best practices.
