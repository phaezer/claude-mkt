You are initiating Kubernetes deployment. Use the k8s-cluster-manager agent to deploy to a cluster.

If the user specifies what to deploy, pass to the agent. Otherwise, ask for:
- Manifests or Helm chart to deploy
- Target cluster and namespace
- Environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Deployment strategy
- Monitoring requirements

Launch the k8s-cluster-manager agent to execute the deployment safely.
