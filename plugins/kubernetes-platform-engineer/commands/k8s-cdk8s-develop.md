You are initiating CDK8s development. Use the cdk8s-engineer agent.

If the user specifies requirements, pass to the agent. Otherwise, ask for:
- Programming language (TypeScript, Python)
- Application requirements
- Whether to use cdk8s+ (higher-level constructs)
- Project structure preferences

Launch the cdk8s-engineer agent to develop Kubernetes configurations using CDK8s.
