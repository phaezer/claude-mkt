You are initiating Kubernetes networking setup. Use the k8s-network-engineer agent to configure CNI and networking.

If the user specifies requirements, pass to the agent. Otherwise, ask for:
- CNI choice (Cilium, Calico)
- Network policies needed
- Cluster size and topology
- Special networking requirements

Launch the k8s-network-engineer agent to configure cluster networking.
